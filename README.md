GUESS THE RECT

You start with three rectangles and a ball hiding beneath one of them. 
Your goal is to find that ball by clicking on the rect you think is hiding it. 
ou have two tries before the game ends. If you guess the rectangle, you go up a level. 
With every level the rectangles become more and more and your chances – less. Do you have what it takes?

============================================================================================================

We use KineticJS for drawing the rectangles. Each one has an onclick event which lifts the rectangle using a given formula. 
A counter is used to determine if the player should keep on trying or the game should end. 
If the player guesses the rectangle the counter is restarted and new two tries are given to him for the next level. 
If the player doesn’t guess in all the tries he has - the game ends and a “Game Over” message appears on screen.
